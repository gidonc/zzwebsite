<p>Zig-Zag RZR is the first team in the Zig-Zag family. RZR was formed (as Zig-Zag Racers) at the end of June 2019 (at the start of the Newfangled vehicles event). It was born from the embers of rizzlaracers, a some time top 30 team brought down by an inactive leader.</p>
<p>RZR was last recorded as having 10369 cups and being ranked 47 in the world. This measurement was taken going into the match against Team China (sweaty palms 2).</p>
<p>Since formation RZR has played 155 matches, winning 115 of those (a win percentage of 74%). Of their most recent 15 matches RZR have won 11 (a recent win percentage of 73%).</p>
