<p>Zig-Zag GT is the third team in the Zig-Zag family. It was formed at the end of December 2019 (during the Let it Slide event) as an academy team for Zig-Zag. It was known as Zig-Zag Racerz. It changed its name to Zig-Zag GT after merging with parts of two other teams: first, the leadership of GrandTour (formerly Khaleesi) and second, parts of GreasySpanner.</p>
<p>GT currently has 7911 cups and is ranked 1243 in the world. This was measured going into the match against SkidMarks (canyonball 4).</p>
<p>Since formation GT has played 62 matches, winning 56 of those (a win percentage of 90%). Of their most recent 15 matches GT have won 14 (a recent win percentage of 93%).</p>
