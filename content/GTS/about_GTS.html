<p>Zig-Zag GT is the third team in the Zig-Zag family. It was formed at the end of December 2019 (during the Let it Slide event) as an academy team for Zig-Zag. It was known as Zig-Zag Racerz. It changed its name to Zig-Zag GT after merging with parts of two other teams: first, the leadership of GrandTour (formerly Khaleesi) and second, parts of GreasySpanner.</p>
<p>GT was last recorded as having 8549 cups and being ranked 803 in the world. This measurement was taken going into the match against BvB09 Racing (timesplitting 2).</p>
<p>Since formation GT has played 69 matches, winning 62 of those (a win percentage of 90%). Of their most recent 15 matches GT have won 13 (a recent win percentage of 87%).</p>
