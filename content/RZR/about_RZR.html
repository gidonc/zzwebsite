<p>Zig-Zag RZR is the first team in the Zig-Zag family. RZR was formed (as Zig-Zag Racers) at the end of June 2019 (at the start of the Newfangled vehicles event). It was born from the embers of rizzlaracers, a some time top 30 team brought down by an inactive leader.</p>
<p>RZR currently has 9910 cups and is ranked 50 in the world. This was measured going into the match against Bensalenkarlt (billâ€™s ok adventure 1).</p>
<p>Since formation RZR has played 151 matches, winning 112 of those (a win percentage of 74%). Of their most recent 15 matches RZR have won 12 (a recent win percentage of 80%).</p>
