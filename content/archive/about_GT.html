<p>Zig-Zag GT is the third team in the Zig-Zag family. It was formed at the end of December 2019 (during the Let it Slide event) as an academy team for Zig-Zag. It was known as Zig-Zag Racerz. It changed its name to Zig-Zag GT after merging with parts of two other teams: first, the leadership of GrandTour (formerly Khaleesi) and second, parts of GreasySpanner. In May 2020 Zig-Zag GT merged with Zig-Zag GS. The top players from the two teams formed Zig-Zag GTS in the new second team. The other players from the two teams formed the new academy team Zig-Zag GB.</p>
<p>GT was last recorded as having 8549 cups and being ranked 803 in the world. This measurement was taken going into the match against BvB09 Racing (timesplitting 2).</p>
<p>Since formation GT has played 70 matches, winning 62 of those (a win percentage of 89%). Of their most recent 15 matches GT have won 12 (a recent win percentage of 80%).</p>
